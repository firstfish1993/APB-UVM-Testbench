Need to ask the TAs about some "WHY" questions in the ALU UVM lab's TLM

Done the driver, but the driving sequence might be a little too simple. Also has Q
Since we are only using a basic sequencer, I do not think we need to do anything about the sequencer, am I right?
(S) What is the "passive" vif in the monitor? - Should be related with the passive modport in apb_if, therefore I also add "master" on the driver side for vif
